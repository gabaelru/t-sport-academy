Special end-of-year day


On these special dates, we at Toquero Sport Academy want to say goodbye to the year in the best possible way.
On 30 December, we're celebrating Family Day, a very special day in which our players will share the court with their parents.
A perfect opportunity to spend time together, enjoy sport as a family and end the year as it deserves: with values, smiles and good times.
We look forward to seeing you there!
